## How to build

You need `rust` to compile this code. See following web site to install rust tool chain on your machine.
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

In `xiaomi` folder, type following command to build. You need an internet connection.
```
cargo build --release
```

Once the build is successfully completed, you can find the `xiaomi.exe` in the following location. Copy this file to your preferred folder for command line tools.
`target\release\xiaomi.exe`

## How to use

Use `scan` command to discover xiaomi clock around you. In this example, it found my well known device "Tokyo".
```
d:\> xiaomi scan
Start monitoring BLE advertisement... âœ…
Tokyo - ðŸ’§ 68 %
Tokyo - ðŸ”‹ 14 %
Tokyo - ðŸ’§ 68 %
Stop monitoring BLE advertisement... âœ…
Summary:
+-------------------+-------+------------+-----------+
| Device ID         | Temp. | Humidity % | Battery % |
+-------------------+-------+------------+-----------+
| AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF | -     | 68         | 14        |
+-------------------+-------+------------+-----------+
```

Create a toml file to give a human dreadable name to device. Create a `xiaomi.toml` along with `xiaomi.exe` file, need to place in a same folder.
```toml
[[devices]]
## address of the device. use : as a delimiter.
address = "AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF"
## the name of device.
name = "Tokyo"
## timezone of the time. "Asia/Seoul" is also possible.
## note that xiaomi device does not support timezones that don't fall on the hour.
## for example, Indian Standard Time is +05:30, which is not supported.
## in this case, use `offset_seconds` below.
timezone = "Asia/Tokyo"
## uncomment following line if you do not want to sync the device.
# omit = true
## sometimes you may want to set a clock 5 minutes ahead or 5 minutes behind.
## use +300 for 5 minutes ahead, -300 for 5 minutes behind.
# offset_seconds = +300

# define another device if you have more.
# [[devices]]
```

Then use `sync` command to sync the clock. Following is an example output of sync.
```
d:\> xiaomi sync
Start monitoring BLE advertisement... âœ…
Tokyo: Connecting...
Tokyo: Querying service, UUID=ebe0ccb07a0a4b0c8a1a6ff2997da3a6
Tokyo: Querying characteristic, UUID=ebe0ccb77a0a4b0c8a1a6ff2997da3a6
Tokyo: Sync clock 1696891938 [timezone:+9]
Waiting worker thread complete...
Stop monitoring BLE advertisement... âœ…
```
